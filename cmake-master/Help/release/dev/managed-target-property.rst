target property COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME
---------------------------------------

* The :prop_tgt:`COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME` target property was introduced
  to configure the use of managed C++ for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
  for VS 2010 and above.
* To support ``C++/CLI`` for imported targets, the
  :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME` was added.
